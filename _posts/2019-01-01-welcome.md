### About me

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am adjunt professor at Institute of Science Exatas and Technology at Federal 
I am twenty years old and I am a student in the Mathematics Degree course.
I am a little shy and quite exaggerated at times.
I am currently in the sixth period and seek to improve myself in mathematical games, focusing on education.
I'm certainly not the best at what I do, but I try to do my best, if I can teach at least one person using what I love, I'm already satisfied
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I want to be able to make a game that can teach every basic math to help as many people as possible
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
### Goals and dreams

I do not have many dreams or goals, my only goal is to really get to form, even with my problems.
I don't have much potential for bigger goals, so I want to focus on smaller dreams where I have a better chance of success. Nowadays I really want to be able to reward all the help I received from my teachers and try to give them less work.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I work with R programming, with Latex, with Linux. I am Ana Beatriz's father, Elizete's husband and in love with my family and my profession!
