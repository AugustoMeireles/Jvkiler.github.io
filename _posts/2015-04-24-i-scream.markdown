### Jv Games
JV Games is the logo of the games I produce, I like to make educational games, but lately I've been working on some games with more adventure focused.
Officially I have released three games, two focused on teaching basic math.
Most games are 2D, made on the "RPG MAKER" platform, but future projects are being made on the "Unity" platform.
I am developing two games as I have free time, one of them called "Chess Battle" and the other "The Last Light"
Since the idea is just to do something fun or just help someone learn math, every game made is completely free

### New releases.
Games do not have fixed release dates as they are only done when I have some free time.
But it seems that The Last Light will be released later this year, because now that I have more domain in the platform I am doing much faster content creation.
There are some game advancement teasers on the youtube and Facebook Game Channel.
