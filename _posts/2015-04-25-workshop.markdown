### The beginning

Speaking of me, I'm currently twenty years old.
Despite being a little troublesome and overdone with almost everything, I try to do my best in what I'm doing.
I am very shy and stubborn when it comes to taking risks.
I study math degree and I'm in the sixth period (or at least it should be ...)
 I am part of a project focused on improving future teachers, and if all goes well I will participate in a chess extension project later this year.
I love games and their ability to teach, so I'm very focused on learning more about this subject.
I'm not the best at what I do, but if I can teach at least one person with something I love, I will be pleased.

### Goals and dreams

I do not have many dreams and goals, currently only desire to be able to form, and at this time learn as much as possible.
And somehow repay all the help I've ever received.
