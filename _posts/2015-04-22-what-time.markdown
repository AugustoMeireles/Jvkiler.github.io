### intention
These are games that I made with the idea of teaching Basic Math in a different way.
Even if it takes a long time, my plan is to play with all the stuff in basic education.
I have made the first game, which works with the basic operations and the next game will probably be about fractions and statics. The games are made for computers and mobile. It is important to say that games are not a substitute for a material class, it is just a way of training the knowledge learned in the classroom in a dynamic and fun way.

### A Mathematical Question
A math question was my first game made for educational purposes.
In this game you control a character who needs to go to each classroom to answer the teachers' challenges, the game starts with Sum and Subtraction questions, and goes into Multiplication and Division as it progresses.
The game was developed in 2017 for my work on "Teaching Practice 1"
Initially the language is Portuguese, but it is already possible to play in English.

In 2019-2020 I am doing a remake of the game, now that I have more advanced knowledge, I am doing it turns into an even more satisfying experience.
