### I don't know a title for that

I didn't know what to put in here, so I decided to put in just a few life experiences I've been through and updating over time, something like a diary I think.
I always had a little anxiety and she eventually developed into higher education, which caused a shock in the first year of the course.
But luckily I met some people who completely changed my life, friends that I hope to take for the rest of my life, even though some I never see again after graduating, I hope someday to be able to repay everything I was given.
Many of my goals during the course are being done, nothing too big, things like "getting past some math stuff."
What I am looking for now is to try to give my teachers less work and get a degree.
If I can do it, I don't know, but I'll keep tapping while I'm standing
