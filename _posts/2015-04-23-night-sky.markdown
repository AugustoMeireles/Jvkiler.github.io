### I don't know a title for that

I didn't know what to put in here, so I decided to put in just a few life experiences I've been through and updating over time, something like a diary I think.
I always had a little anxiety and she eventually developed into higher education, which caused a shock in the first year of the course.
But luckily I met some people who completely changed my life, friends that I hope to take for the rest of my life, even though some I never see again after graduating, I hope someday to be able to repay everything I was given.
Many of my goals during the course are being done, nothing too big, things like "getting past some math stuff."
What I am looking for now is to try to give my teachers less work and get a degree.
If I can do it, I don't know, but I'll keep tapping while I'm standing

### 08/12/2019

   I’ve decided that I’m going to update this page over the days, taking advantage of the fact that it’s a personal page and probably no one will read it, and it turns out to be safer than the texts I typed into the computer.
It’s weird to type for myself, but in the end I feel like it’s a conversation with my real self, so I decided to put some things I’ve written in the past and connect with my current thinking, so let’s get on with it.
 Well, it’s been a really hard time on the course lately, so I think because it’s something that I love so much, it hurts so much, too. It’s torture, every day I come on campus and put on a mask, pretend like it’s okay and always laugh, it’s a very high wear and tear, especially because it’s innocent, so sometimes I’m doing something without realizing it, strange as it seems, I don’t feel like giving up or anything, but sometimes I think, if it’s worth it.
 I can’t complain about help, because if there’s one thing that I got on campus at all, it’s this, but it’s painful enough, you can see the pity of teachers, my grades and income have increased over time, But it was at the same time that the teachers understood my anxiety problem, which makes me question it every day. “I was approved by merit or piety?” And it bothers me every day, I feel like I’m being kicked, the way they treat me and talk to me, it just feels like pity, most of them are too nice to be normal.
In the matter of friendships is even worse, I’m afraid to say something and lose the friendship of the person, I get desperate if anything seems different from the ordinary, teachers I consider friends, I freak out if I think I said anything wrong, the fear of disappointing, the fear of failing, the fear of losing what little I have, are things I never deserved to have, so I can’t risk losing that. I consider myself quite selfish, so I prefer the happiness of others than mine, it seems to be something fairer with everyone.
 I have a lot of desire to do master’s and things like that, my biggest dream should be to get to teach at the top, especially if it could be here in the forest UFV same, I like a lot of the people I met, it would be a dream one day to teach next to them, but as I said it’s a dream, I don’t have enough grades to get into a master’s degree, I don’t have the capacity for the same and even worse condition to get into a university. So I don’t have many plans and no expectations for the future, since my dream is impossible, I’m going to form somehow, I’m going to lose contact with these teachers and classmates that I talked about, and I’ll probably go back to being like I always was before I got here, just another person who doesn’t have an opinion of his own, which is probably why I don’t care much about health and having several long years of life, Getting a degree will make me happy, because it’s something that shows my limit.
Like after I graduate I don’t have plans for the future anymore, I’m trying to have all the experiences.
